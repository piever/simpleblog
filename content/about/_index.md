I am a Neuroscience PhD student at the [Mainen Lab](http://www.neuro.fchampalimaud.org/en/research/investigators/research-groups/group/Mainen/). I am an amateur developer/game designer and I particularly like to use open source tools (in particular the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and the game engine [Godot](https://julialang.org/)). Here I will blog about those tools (and potentially other things). You can check out most things I do on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/piever).
