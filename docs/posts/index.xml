      <description>Numbers and math In the previous post we mainly played with strings, but Julia is also very good at math. In this post we will do some math in Julia.
Integer and and non integer numbers Julia accept both integer numbers and non integer numbers (with a decimal point). All basic (and often non basic) mathematical functions are implemented in Julia. Here we will play a bit with the four basic operations (+, -, *, /), the exponentiation operator (^) and the comparison operators (&amp;gt;, ==, &amp;lt;).</description>

      <description>Learning how to code This is the first of a series of posts aimed about the Julia programming language. Julia is a reasonably young language designed for scientific computing. Despite being free, fast and elegantly designed, Julia is not as widely used as I think it should be. I also believe that, due to its simplicity and clarity, Julia makes for a good first programming language. In case some newcomers to programming are curious enough to give Julia a try, I&amp;rsquo;m making a series of tutorials about it, starting from the very beginning.</description>
